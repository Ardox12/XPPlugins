# ToggleMouseLook
A plugin for X-Plane 11 that adds commands for better control of mouse look.

The plugin adds two new commands that mimic the mouse look behaviour of Prepar3D:

1. Press and hold the assigned key, then move the mouse to look around
2. Press the assigned key to toggle the mouse look function ON or OFF.

Please note this plugin is for the Windows version of X-Plane 11 only. It does **not** work with either MacOS or Linux versions.
