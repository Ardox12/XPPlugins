# ToggleMouseLook
A plugin for X-Plane 11 that adds commands for better control of mouse look.

The plugin changes the behaviour of the right-mouse button so that a right-click toggles mouse look on or off. It also adds two new commands that mimic the mouse look behaviour of Prepar3D:

1. Press and hold the assigned key, then move the mouse to look around
2. Press the assigned key to toggle the mouse look function ON or OFF.
